# Python-Gear-Calculator
Calculates gear mechanisms based on ratio input.

This was one of my first actual coding applications.
It's messy, and horribly inefficient.

You simply give it a gear ratio, amount of gears it can use, maximum and minimum number of teeth, and max difference betwwen the found
ratio and input ratio.
It only uses simple gears.
